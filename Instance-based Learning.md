- Supervised learning algos: learned from labelled examples
	- input: instances.
	- model: some kind of function that maps instances to class labels.
- Instance-based learning:
	- required labelled examples stored in memory.
	- learns directly by example.

### Feature vectors

- n-dimensional vector of features that represent an instance.

#### Similarity

- numerical measure of how alike 2 data objects are.
- [0, 1], higher when objects are more alike.

#### Dissimilarity

- Numerical measure of how different of 2 data objects
- Lower when objects are more alike, min is 0, upper varies

### Nearest Neighbor Classification

- max similarity or min distance
