### Machine learning tasks

- classification
- clustering
- regression
- probability estimation
- sequence discovery
- association rule mining
- model fitting

### ML vs. data mining/science

- theory > application (< for data mining)
- ignore runtime/complexity (accuracy > efficiency) (< for data mining)
- DS focuses on both
